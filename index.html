    <h2 class="title">Amazon adventurer</h2>
    <p class="paragraph">
        Ed Stafford from the UK is the first person to walk the length of the Amazon River.
        He started by a small stream in the Andes mountains of Peru and arrived at the river’s
        mouth in Brazil, two years and four months later, having walked 6,000 kilometres.
        The Amazon rainforest is home to poisonous snakes, crocodiles and jaguars, so Ed was in constant danger.
        Luckily, he survived with nothing worse than a few thousand mosquito and ant bites. On his trip,
        Ed had to find food to eat every day. A lot of the time, the fruit, nuts and fish he ate were hard to find
        and he often felt weak and exhausted. Ed’s walk would have been impossible without technology.
        He used a radio to ask the people of the rainforest for food and permission to cross their land.
        Many of them came to meet him and helped guide him through the most difficult terrain.
        As he walked Ed wrote a blog, recording his day-to-day experiences.
        He used the media interest in his trip to protest about the destruction of the rainforest
        and raise money for environmental and children’s charities in Brazil and Peru.

    <h2 class="title">Art or vandalism?</h2>
    <p class="paragraph">
        Is graffiti art or vandalism? This depends on your point of view, but in many countries,
        writing or painting on public or private property is considered vandalism.
        Many street artists have been stopped by the police and some have had to pay fines.
        Many city councils complain about the high cost of cleaning graffiti off buildings, buses and trains.
        In some areas, councils have tried to encourage artists not to paint randomly on walls
        by allowing them to work in designated areas. Taiwan is one such place and there are 'graffiti zones'
        where artists are free to paint and write on walls. In São Paulo in Brazil,
        the city council has even allowed some graffiti artists to paint on the city's subway trains.
        And what does the art world think of graffiti and street art? Recently,
        there has been a growing recognition of its value as an art form.
        There have been major exhibitions of street art in galleries in Paris, London and Los Angeles.
        The American artist Elura Emerald organised a street art exhibition at a New York gallery in 2008.
        She defended street artists, saying 'artists who paint on the street are merely expressing themselves, not
        hurting anyone.
        They should be appreciated and celebrated'.

    <h2 class="title">Where did the idea for The Hunger Games come from?</h2>
    <p class="paragraph">
        One night in 2003, Suzanne Collins was flipping between channels on TV. It was at the time of the US invasion of
        Iraq.
        The only programmes she could find on TV were ‘reality’ programmes of young people competing to win a million
        dollars
        and news programmes about the war. Suzanne says that the two things start to merge together in a disturbing way
        and the idea for The Hunger Games came to her.
        She has always found news programmes of wars upsetting. When she was a child, her father was a pilot in the US
        air force
        and he fought in Vietnam. Her mother tried to protect her by not telling her what was happening in the war,
        but she still saw news programmes about the war and knew that her dad was there.
        It was a very frightening experience for her.
        Another important inspiration for the book comes from Suzanne’s love of classical Greek mythology.
        When she was a child, one of her favourite stories was Theseus and the Minotaur.
        In this story the city of Athens is ruled by Crete, but the Athenians rebel. As a punishment,
        Minos the king of Crete forces the Athenians to send seven boys and seven girls to Crete every year.
        The youths are thrown into the labyrinth and eaten by a monster that lives there called the Minotaur.
        But one of the youths, named Theseus, fights the Minotaur and kills it.
        Suzanne sees Katniss Everdeen as a futuristic Theseus. Another classical inspiration comes from the ancient
        Roman games,
        where gladiators have to fight to the death for people’s entertainment.

    <h2 class="title">More than one adventure</h2>
    <p class="paragraph">
        Some adventurers are always looking for a new challenge. Meagan McGrath from Canada has climbed mountains,
        ridden a bike across Canada and run races in the desert. But her most incredible journey was a skiing trip
        to the South Pole. As she skied, Meagan pulled a sledge with a tent and all her food.
        She skied through terrible storms and freezing temperatures for forty days till she arrived at the South Pole.
        Erik Weihenmayer from the United States has climbed mountains and ridden a bike through deserts.
        Amazingly, Erik is blind and he wants other blind people to have active lives too.
        He has taken groups of young blind people climbing in Nepal.

    <h2 class="title">Climate changes triggered immigration to America</h2>
    <p class="paragraph">
        In the 19th century, over 5 million Germans moved to North America. It was not only a century of poverty,
        war and revolutions in what is now Germany, but also of variable climate.
        Starting at the tail end of the cold period known as the Little Ice Age, the century saw glacier advances in the Alps,
        and a number of chilly winters and cool summers, as well as other extreme weather events such as droughts and floods.
